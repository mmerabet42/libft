# Libft

**libft** is a library of C functions.

It is the very first project in the Ecole 42 cursus. The library might and is supposed to grow thoughout my progress in the cursus. And because this library is about reinventing the wheel we make sure of reinventing it only once.

## Installation

```bash
$> git clone https://github.com/mmerabet42/libft.git libft
$> cd libft
$> make
```

The `make` command will generate a `libft.a` file that should be used to compile your projects
